Explain dimension reduction in machine learning.
In machine learning classification problems, there are often too many factors on the basis of which the final classification is done.
These factors are basically variables called features. 
The higher the number of features, the harder it gets to visualize the training set and then work on it.
Sometimes, most of these features are correlated, and hence redundant.
This is where dimensionality reduction algorithms come into play. 
Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration, by obtaining a set of principal variables. 
It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction.

The two components of dimensionality reduction:
Feature selection: In this, we try to find a subset of the original set of variables, or features, to get a smaller subset which can be used to model the problem.
It usually involves three ways:
-Filter
-Wrapper
-Embedded
Feature extraction: This reduces the data in a high dimensional space to a lower dimension space, i.e. a space with lesser no. of dimensions.

The various methods used for dimensionality reduction include:
-Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
-Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
-Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA)

Advantages of Dimensionality Reduction:
It helps in data compression, and hence reduced storage space.
It reduces computation time.
It also helps remove redundant features.
